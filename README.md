# FontLoaderSubRe

Heavily inspired by [FontLoaderSub](https://github.com/yzwduck/FontLoaderSub).

Drag-and-drop ASS/SSA subtitles and it will load corresponding font files in its directory.

## Usage

1. Place the executable in the font directory. (For Windows only).
2. Open FontLoaderSubRe, set font directory path (For Mac and Linux, will change default directory if on Windows), index the fonts from menu. (Only required if there is updates to the fonts. Window may freeze when indexing.)
3. Drag-and-drop subtitles `*.ass` (or folders) onto `FontLoaderSubRe` window, or its icon and shortcut(For Windows only).

## Changes

* Redesigned with Python and Tkinter.
* Faster font file indexing.

## TODO

[ ] Linux compatibility.
