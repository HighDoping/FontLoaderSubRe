# FontLoaderSubRe

Heavily inspired by [FontLoaderSub](https://github.com/yzwduck/FontLoaderSub).

Drag-and-drop ASS/SSA subtitles and it will load corresponding font files in its directory.

## Usage

1. Move `FontLoaderSub.exe` to the root of font directory;
1. Drag-and-drop subtitles `*.ass` (or folders) onto `FontLoaderSub.exe`.

## Changes

* Redesigned with Python and Tkinter.
* Faster font file indexing.

## TODO

[ ] macOS compatibility.

[ ] Linux compatibility.
